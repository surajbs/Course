Informational -  have to be simple so best not be not complex. So it is simple and informational.
Statistical -  frame of reference to the topics are good.
Self Reflective - I found it myself very simple and easily explained or itâ€™s simple, its actionable and its peritonitis
I guess the above mentioned points are more than enough to explain on NumPy and PANDAS.

what I learned from NumPy and PANDAS:
1. Arrays, NumPy arrays, Indexing, slicing.
2. Data Frame, Rows and Columns, Pivot Tables, merging and appending Dataframes and all operations of Dataframes.
